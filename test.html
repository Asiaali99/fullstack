    <p>I hope this email finds you well. I have signed up and enrolled for the full-stack bootcamp, and alhamdulillah we started that yesterday.<br><br>
          I have previously expressed my interest in wanting to do boh the freelancing and full stack courses together, 
          however I was slightly confused as to how I could do these together or how you would make it a joined bootcamp amongst the three options.<br><br>
          Could I please also enroll for the freelancing course as well? Do let me know what I need to do in order to get started with the freelancing course. Many thanks.</p>
